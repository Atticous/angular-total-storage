jquery-total-storage
====================

## What makes it TOTAL Storage?
 
 * The browser doesn't support local storage it will fall-back to cookies! (Using the
   wonderful $.cookie plugin).
 * Send it strings, numbers even complex object arrays! TotalStorage does not care.
   Your efforts to defeat it will prove futile. 
 * Simple as shit. jStorage and some other very well-written plugins provide a bevy of
   options for expiration, security and so forth. Frequently this is more power than you
   need and vulnerable to confusion if you're just want it to work (JWITW)
 
## Some examples  
 * @desc Set the value of a key to a string
 * @example $.totalStorage('the_key', 'the_value');
 * @desc Set the value of a key to a number
 * @example $.totalStorage('the_key', 800.2);
 * @desc Set the value of a key to a complex Array
 * @example	var myArray = new Array();
 *			myArray.push({name:'Jared', company:'Upstatement', zip:63124});
			myArray.push({name:'McGruff', company:'Police', zip:60652};
			$.totalStorage('people', myArray);
			//to return:
			$.totalStorage('people');
